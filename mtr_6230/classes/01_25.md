## Week 2: 01/25

Negotiating the NIH: Decisions Prior to Submission 
Grant mechanisms, ESI status, Single vs. Multiple-PI, Interacting with the NIH

* It's not necessary to submit to the PA/RFA that we put in the application
  * we can change our minds: maybe something related to PhenoPLIER instead of CCC?
* there are office hours:
  * 9-11 on Fridays
* NOT-OD-23-012: there was a change in forms (FORMS-H is the right one now)
* NOT-OD-22-189: data sharing
* Biosketches:
  * specific to application
  * the personal statement should differ depending on what mechanism we are submitting to
  * reviewers read this
* R01:
  * concentrate on scientific achievemetns to date, what you have found
  * show how your expertise will allow you to address the questions you are posing
  * reader should at least have an idea of what you are proposing
  * you can mention one or two mentors, but this is an INDEPENDENT AWARD,
    * and who you worked with will be evident by your papers
  * you need to show you are an independent investigators
* find the right home for your research
  * 27 institutes, generally they are disease-focused
    * not disease-focused: NHGRI and NIGMS (general medicine)
    * those which start with C, such as CC, CIT CSR, are Centers
      * they don't give money
  * familiarize with NIH Reporter (https://reporter.nih.gov)
* intramural vs extramural NIH:
  * intramural:
    * clinical center and laboratories with NIH
    * separate funds
  * extramural:
    * administrative branch of NIH
    * Congress gives NIH money
    * IC (majority of funds)
    * RFA supported by Offices (this is for me):
      * offices in general usually don't have much money
      * Karen:
        * read carefully the RFA
        * TALK WITH the Program Officer
        * (we'll talk soon about this)
* Early Stage Investigator Program Overview:
  * there is a significant advantage to be an ESI
  * payline is better (higher)
  * be aware of personal timeline, plan to resubmit if close to 10 years
  * being a co-investigator in an R01 by another PI does not make you lose your ESI status
  * extensions to 10 years limit:
    * childbirth, family care responsibilities, disability or illness
    * When should we submit this?
      * Karen:
        * not sure, but look at the link (NOT-OD-09-034)
        * IMPORTANT: but in the NIH, the sooner the better
* Early Career Reviewer Program:
  * for assistant professors only
  * you learn a lot
  * you work side-by-side with some of the most accomplished researchers in your field
* paylines:
  * the slides say not to direct application because it has a higher payline, but instead stick to the science
    * the science will determine the IC
  * Continuing Resolution:
    * money comes from Congress
    * so many to the NIH could not come on time
* Strategizing the submission of multiple applications:
  * submit different applications in different cycles/years
    * this avoids mulitple renewal/revision submissions at the same time (you increase the pressure on yourself)
      * if you believe both applications are going to the same study section, you'll be competing with yourself
      * reviewers would not feel comfortable giving two grants to the same person
    * protect salary and lab
    * SEE SLIDES HERE AGAIN
* steps in deciding which study section:
  * use the AART to see which study section are at the top of the list
  * look at the roster of those study section under consideration:
    * are you familiare with the names of the reviewers?
    * do you cite those reviewers in your application?
    * does your mentor know them? do his/her grants go to that study section?
    * be careful with conflicts of interest (in case of K99 I think?)
    * if not sure, email the SRO (scientific review officer), include specific aims with request
  

* study sections:
  * when they review the applications, they grouped the ESIs together so reviewers do not mix with senior investigators


SUMMARY:
  MENTION ALL THIS TO CASEY IN THE NEXT MEETING
  I SHOULD APPLY FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE ESI STATUS AS SOON AS I START AS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR
  ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE EARLY CAREER REVIEWER PROGRAM
