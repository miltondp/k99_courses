## Week 2: 01/25

Negotiating the NIH: Decisions Prior to Submission 
Grant mechanisms, ESI status, Single vs. Multiple-PI, Interacting with the NIH

* It's not necessary to submit to the PA/RFA that we put in the application
  * we can change our minds: maybe something related to PhenoPLIER instead of CCC?
* there are office hours:
  * 9-11 on Fridays
* NOT-OD-23-012: there was a change in forms (FORMS-H is the right one now)
* NOT-OD-22-189: data sharing
* Biosketches:
  * specific to application
  * the personal statement should differ depending on what mechanism we are submitting to
  * reviewers read this
* R01:
  * concentrate on scientific achievemetns to date, what you have found
  * show how your expertise will allow you to address the questions you are posing
  * reader should at least have an idea of what you are proposing
  * you can mention one or two mentors, but this is an INDEPENDENT AWARD,
    * and who you worked with will be evident by your papers
  * you need to show you are an independent investigators
* find the right home for your research
  * 27 institutes, generally they are disease-focused
    * not disease-focused: NHGRI and NIGMS (general medicine)
    * those which start with C, such as CC, CIT CSR, are Centers
      * they don't give money
  * familiarize with NIH Reporter (https://reporter.nih.gov)
* intramural vs extramural NIH:
  * intramural:
    * clinical center and laboratories with NIH
    * separate funds
  * extramural:
    * administrative branch of NIH
    * Congress gives NIH money
    * IC (majority of funds)
    * RFA supported by Offices (this is for me):
      * offices in general usually don't have much money
      * Karen:
        * read carefully the RFA
        * TALK WITH the Program Officer
        * (we'll talk soon about this)
* Early Stage Investigator Program Overview:
  * there is a significant advantage to be an ESI
  * payline is better (higher)
  * be aware of personal timeline, plan to resubmit if close to 10 years
  * being a co-investigator in an R01 by another PI does not make you lose your ESI status
  * extensions to 10 years limit:
    * childbirth, family care responsibilities, disability or illness
    * When should we submit this?
      * Karen:
        * not sure, but look at the link (NOT-OD-09-034)
        * IMPORTANT: but in the NIH, the sooner the better
* Early Career Reviewer Program:
  * for assistant professors only
  * you learn a lot
  * you work side-by-side with some of the most accomplished researchers in your field
* paylines:
  * the slides say not to direct application because it has a higher payline, but instead stick to the science
    * the science will determine the IC
  * Continuing Resolution:
    * money comes from Congress
    * so many to the NIH could not come on time
* Strategizing the submission of multiple applications:
  * submit different applications in different cycles/years
    * this avoids mulitple renewal/revision submissions at the same time (you increase the pressure on yourself)
      * if you believe both applications are going to the same study section, you'll be competing with yourself
      * reviewers would not feel comfortable giving two grants to the same person
    * protect salary and lab
    * SEE SLIDES HERE AGAIN
* steps in deciding which study section:
  * use the ART (Assisted Referral Tool) to see which study section are at the top of the list
    * ART is very useful
    * I tried ART with my K99 and it suggested a couple study sections (SRG and RB or review branch)
  * look at the roster of those study section under consideration:
    * are you familiare with the names of the reviewers?
    * do you cite those reviewers in your application?
    * does your mentor know them? do his/her grants go to that study section?
    * be careful with conflicts of interest (in case of K99 I think?)
    * if not sure, email the SRO (scientific review officer), include specific aims with request
* types of grants mechanisms:
  * a parent mechanisms is a program announcement (PA) that is joined by multiple IC
    * make sure your IC joins it
  * Program Announcement (PA) identifies areas of science
    * remains active for three years
    * special types: PAR (special recept, referral and/or review) or PAS (set-aside funds)
  * Request for Application (RFA)
    * my case with CCC
    * more narrowly defined area
    * look at the amount of money and how many grants are going to fund
    * set aside money (this is good and bad)
      * I HAVE TO SPEAK WITH THE PROGRAM OFFICIAL
      * not usually percentiled
    * if it has single receipt date, there is no chance to resubmit
    * usually reviewed by a Scientific Review Group convened by the issuing awarding component
  * NOSI: Notice of Special Interest
* Types of applications:
  * R mechanisms:
    * R01:
      * https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-185.html
      * always pay attention to "Related Notices"
      * PA-20-185: it's a parent announcement that was released in 2020
      * most commonly used grant program
      * No more than $500k (direct costs)
        * not a good idea to surpass this limit as junior PI
      * Generally awarded for 3-5 years
      * utilized by all IC
    * R21:
      * 2 years
      * no preliminary data (but some at least should be given)
      275k
* How to read an NIH grant mechanism:
  * active dates, due dates, NOSIs, eligibility, budget restrictions, attachment instructions, review criteria
  * THIS IS SPECIALLY TRUE FOR RFAs, because targeted funds are assigned
    * very detailed instructions regarding objectives of the proposal, what should be included, budget, etc
    * For example, in my RFA (), it's IMPORTANT to look at the Section II / "Funds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards"
