## Week 4: 02/08

Building the Research Strategy: Background, Research Plan, Preliminary Data,
Figures, Budget

Initial remarks:
* it's a good idea to repeat hypothesis, aims and approaches through the grant (aims page and approach)
* in soliciting feedback on your application, you *will* receive conflicting comments; this is confusing
* one figure is allowed to have figures on Specific Aims page
  * make sure it's perfectly clear and correct
  * it could make hypothesis more clear
* figure that show preliminary data
  * it has to show strong results

Significance:
* generate excitement about project and questions being asked
* are you asking an important scientific question?

Preliminary data:
* either a subsection of approach (i don't like it) or integrate it into significance, innovation and approach
* include preliminary data to support each hypothesis

Organization of application, general principals:
* make the application as easy to read as possible; clean and straighforward
* add bold headers or an outlining or numbering system that you use consistently
