## Week 4: 02/08

Building the Research Strategy: Background, Research Plan, Preliminary Data,
Figures, Budget

Initial remarks:
* it's a good idea to repeat hypothesis, aims and approaches through the grant (aims page and approach)
* in soliciting feedback on your application, you *will* receive conflicting comments; this is confusing
* one figure is allowed to have figures on Specific Aims page
  * make sure it's perfectly clear and correct
  * it could make hypothesis more clear
* figure that show preliminary data
  * it has to show strong results

Significance:
* generate excitement about project and questions being asked
* are you asking an important scientific question?

Preliminary data:
* either a subsection of approach (i don't like it) or integrate it into significance, innovation and approach
* include preliminary data to support each hypothesis

Organization of application, general principals:
* make the application as easy to read as possible; clean and straighforward
* add bold headers or an outlining or numbering system that you use consistently

How to be concise and make the grant easier to read:
* organize with sub headings relevant to the point you want to make
* be judicious about underlining and bolding
* be consistent
* published methodologies can be briefly described

Approach:
* **IMPORTANT:** scoring of the approach section has the highest correlation with overall score
* describe design of study
* experimental methodology
* demonstratino/statement of rigor
* preliminary data
* sex as biological variable
* discuss outcomes, potential pitfalls, weaknesses and alternative hypothesis
* timeline for whole application
* how to organize this section:
  * a common way is to organize by aims:
    * heading (restate aim)
    * hypothesis
    * background
    * significance
    * innovation
    * approach
    * rigor:
      * application of scientific method to ensure robust and unbiased results through optimal experimental design, methodologies, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results
      * positive and negative controls
    * sex as biological variable
    * interpretations, limitations
