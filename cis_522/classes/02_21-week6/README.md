## Week 6 - Deep Learning Thinking

### 02/21

* we were talking about homework 3:
  * cosine method that goes up, then it goes down in an angle, goes up again, etc

* Tutorial 1 in this week is almost the same as we did last week, so today we worked on tutorial 2
* So Tutorial 2:
  * the slides at the beginning are interesting
  * problem of predicting neuron spikes given 12 parameters of a motorcycle
  * we predict lambda, the parameter of the Poisson distribution
  * Hainiu said that this is a "Recognition network"
  * a cost function could be the Negative Log Likelihood (NLL)
