## 01/31 - Introduction to Genetics Medicine

Theodore Drivas

* understading common disease helps to understand rare disease, and vicebersa
* disease threshold (he didn't mention so far the omnigenic approach)
* genetic testing:
  * we might be close to have a single genetic test for everything when WGS coms out
  * karyotyping
    * useful to see what happens in trisomy 21, and other diseases with chromosome abnormalities
  * sanger sequencing:
    * first DNA sequencing method
    * he explained how it works
  * microarray:
    * high resolution
    * two types: CGH and SNP arrays
    * each spot is a genome position (SNP1, SNP2, etc)
      * each one has two bases that are common in the population; they will be red or green
      * if c/c -> red
      * if a/a -> green
      * if a/c -> yellow
      * measure color and intensity
  * next gen sequencing
    * what we do now
    * multi-step process that relies on informatics technique
    * we get random sequences of the DNA
    * then we need to align them with a reference genome
  * karyotype, sanger, microarray and ngs: all have pros and cons

* lessons from the clinic:
  * Face2Gene (a tool to compare faces)
  * sometimes we have no clue what we're looking for
    * case 3: 49yo man with severe intelectual disability
      * Teddy showed the pedigree
      * when all else fails, exome sequence?
      * they found MECP2 gene, not what they were expecting to find
        * gene on the X chromosome
        * Rett syndrome
    * case 4:
      * 28yo man with retinal degeneration, concern for stargardt disease
        * a very upsettting case
        * ATXN7 gene, the person had 55 repeats
    * case 5: only karyotypes wokred
* GWAS:
  * first GWAS in 2002
  * it finds regions associated, not specific genes or variants
* Polygenic Risk Scores:
* PheWAS:
  * take a single genotype, and check associations across a range of phenotypes
* DTC testing:
  * HAS A REAL-WORLD NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON INDIVIDUALS
* Concerns:
  * referral bias
  * well-founded mistrust of the medical system
    * minority patients, particularly black, are less likely to feel comfortable consenting to testing
    * even if they make it past these hurdles, patients of underrpresented ancestry groups are less likely to receive a diagnosis from  genetic testing
  * lack of diversity
